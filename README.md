# Please stay at home

The easiest way to ask your web audience to stay at home. Let's work together and fight against coronavirus!

## Contribute translations & links

Please help us to translate copy (`data/languages.json`) and find relevant links (`data/urls.json`).

Recommendations from local authorities and country-specific links can be referenced by using locales as keys. For example, `de-ch` would be displayed to a German speaking audience in Switzerland. Translations listed with languages as keys act as fallbacks. For example, `de` would be displayed to German speaking audiences without specific local recommenations.

Feel free to open a pull request or mail us at hi@stayathomebanner.com.
